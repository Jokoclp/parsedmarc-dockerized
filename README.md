# parsedmarc-dockerized

Note: The standalone `parsedmarc` docker image on [DockerHub @ accolon/parsedmarc](https://hub.docker.com/r/accolon/parsedmarc) can also be used, if interested.

This stack is based on [patschi's work](https://github.com/patschi/parsedmarc-dockerized) but also builds for and runs on ARM64 systems, e.g. the OCI Cloud Free Tier with Ampere CPUs. It includes a few other tweaks, too: It's running on port 443 by default (can be changed in `docker-compose.yml`) and has HTTP basic authentication enabled (default user/pw is admin/admin).

## Setup:
1. Get basics together:
```
git clone https://github.com/Jokoclp/parsedmarc-dockerized.git /opt/parsedmarc-dockerized/
cd /opt/parsedmarc-dockerized/ && cp data/conf/parsedmarc/config.sample.ini data/conf/parsedmarc/config.ini
```

2. Next we change the `parsedmarc` config (see [docs](https://domainaware.github.io/parsedmarc/#configuration-file). You can set `Test` to `True` for testing purposes.)
```
nano data/conf/parsedmarc/config.ini
```

3. Add your geoipupdate credentials from your [MaxMind account](https://www.maxmind.com/en/account/) to allow the container to pull the databases. For update cycles of the databases, please see [here](https://support.maxmind.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408216129947).
```
nano data/conf/geoipupdate/geoipupdate.env
```

4. Change credentials for HTTP basic auth, e.g. this way (needs apache2-utils or httpd-tools):
```
htpasswd -c data/conf/nginx/htpasswd USERNAME
```

5. Finally, we start up the stack and wait:
```
docker-compose up -d
```

### What's happening then?

1. First, containers of the stack are created and started. This might take a while, as several containers have dependencies on others being in a healthy state (meaning that its service must be fully started).
2. During the startup of the `parsedmarc-init` container, all required steps and preparations are being taken care of - like generating a self-signed certificate for the included `nginx` webserver.
3. Once the Kibana container - where you can view the dashboards - is started up, the corresponding parsedmarc dashboards are automatically imported into Kibana by the `parsedmarc-init` container.
4. After some while, when everything is up and running, you can then access Kibana and its dashboards under the shipped reverse proxy at `https://HOST_IP` (Make sure to use HTTPS!). There will be a warning due to the self-signed certificate. The default username/password for HTTP basic authentication is admin/admin. You should change this!
